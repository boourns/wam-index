# wam-index

## Sequencer.Party plugin index

This repository contains the pre-compiled WAMs that are by default included in Sequencer.Party sessions.  I chose to collect them here to avoid having to build a WAM management interface within Sequencer.Party.

This repository gets uploaded to the sequencer.party servers, so there is no dependency on other hosts existing and not changing URLs.

## Adding your WAM

Written a WAM and want to add it to Sequencer.Party?  Great!! Open a Pull Request and ping @boourns.
